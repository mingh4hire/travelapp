this is the travel app aplication.

You must run the webpack to build the app.
Use the webpack build-dev.

And then you must run the npm run start to begin the app on your local server.

It will give you the textbox to enter a location with length more than 5 characters.

Then it will find a picture using api and also give you the temperature of that location 
using geonames and dark api.

the apis are embedded in this program.

Only caveat is that it may be overloaded for the geonames api so you may have to register for you own api key to use.
